_the mod_

- Colorscheme changes to Unity panel, it is now dark; colorscheme changes to widgets (linked buttons, sidepane) affecting Nautilus
- Worked around a bug that clashes with overlay scrollbars and draws black backgrounds in tabbed nautilus and gedit windows, and in some Ubuntu dialogues
- Replaced the whole GTK2 effort with a simple gtkrc file - was not a big fan of borderless input fields, and the like, in Firefox - but copy of old GTK2 directory still there

_plus_

The panel transparency is set to 70 via Unity Tweak Tool


**Plesetsk** is all about Ubuntu 14.04 with Unity and Gnome 3.10.
